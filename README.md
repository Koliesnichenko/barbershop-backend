# Barbershop Backend API

This is the FastAPI backend for the Barbershop project. It handles user authentication, appointment booking, and management of services and barbers.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- Alembic (migrations)
- Docker / Docker Compose
- JWT authentication

## 🧑‍💻 Setup Instructions for Frontend Developer

### 1. Clone Backend Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_BACKEND_REPO_URL
cd barbershop-backend
git checkout develop
⚠️ Note: All development is currently in the `develop` branch.
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.11+ and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) or `pip` set up. Then:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/barbershop
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

### 4. Run Database in Docker

Make sure Docker is running. Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a PostgreSQL instance on port `5433`.

### 5. Run Migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### 6.  **Create an Admin User**

    To manage barbers, services, and schedules, you'll need an admin user. Run this script to create one via the terminal:

    ```bash
    python create_admin.py
    ```
    Follow the prompts to enter the admin's email, name, phone number (optional), and password. This user will have the `admin` role required for management endpoints.

### 7.  **Seed Initial Data**

    You can populate your database with some initial barbers, services, and addons for testing purposes.

    ```bash
    python seed.py
    ```


### 8. Run the Backend Server

```bash
uvicorn src.app.main:app --reload
```

### 9. API Docs

Open your browser and go to:

```

## 🔌 Connecting Frontend to Backend

Update your API base URL in frontend (Vite config or `.env`):

```
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

⚠️ **Important**: Backend supports CORS with all origins during development (`*`). So you don’t need to worry about CORS errors now.
